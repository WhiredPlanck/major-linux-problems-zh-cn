I fucking hate Linux.

I've just tried to update a working CentOS 6.7 distro to Fedora 24. So, today is the 13th of March, 2016. Roughly 25 years after Linux was founded.

* Nouveau keeps crashing the entire PC (I have a four year old GTX 660 GPU which supposedly should "just work") all the time.
* systemd works like shit:
        * for instance it runs mysterious disk tasks without saying what they are.
        * it fails to reboot the system if there are unresponsive GUI applications running.
        * whenever it cannot mount a partion in fstab it will spew some totally unrelated error message.
        * using the first text terminal is still not possible - moreover systemd tends to clean it upon finishing boot up.
* Google Chrome does NOT work due to SeLinux errors.
* DNF does not show dependencies chains - you never know which packages summon which dependencies.
* Fedora developers hate SysRq as if the Linux kernel has magically become stable - no reboot, no unmount. I have had to run e2fsck at least 20 times (/ + /home) 'cause systemd hang on reboot/shutdown.

In KDE 5:

1) Akregator doesn't work at all - cannot load favicons, spends minutes waiting for KSystemTimeZones, cannot fetch feeds:

* log_akregator: Couldn't reach favicon service. Request favicon for  QUrl("http://feeds.feedburner.com/")  failed

* KSystemTimeZones: ktimezoned initialize() D-Bus call failed:  "Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken."

* -http failed (just like that, not kio_http)

2) There are no xembed icons in systray. I've no idea how to see them. No Skype, Audacious, no Konversation, no Pidgin, no nothing.

3) Plasma takes forever to start and it crashes all the time.

4) There are billions of errors logged like these:

5) I have to have two versions of KDE libraries (4.14.17 and KF5 15.12.2) installed.

6) The DateTime plugin doesn't show different time zones as cities, it shows its ungodly abbreviations. The DateTime plugin doesn't allow to copy the current date/time to clipboard.

7) Visual glitches all around.

8) Plasma chrashes every five minutes. Kwin_x11 crashes. Akregator chrashes.

Ok let's try XFCE?

1) No decent RSS reader - Liferea is an abomination which its developer refuses to make usable for anyone other than himself. Feature requests are not welcomed.
2) No Juk player. Yeah, it's the best library media player in the world.
3) No weather plugin for a taskbar - it crashes all the time.

Actually, I guess I have no choice but to start using XFCE. Fuck the weather. I will try running Akregator from KDE3.

In a process I've filed roughly 10 bugs and subscribed to five others. Linux sucks. Totally sucks.

I've spent 24 hours trying to set up Fedora 23/24. Sorry, if an IT specialist cannot cope with this OS, then this OS should not be called an OS. It's a toy.
